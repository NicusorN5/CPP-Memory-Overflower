# CPP-Memory-Overflower

Repository is archived. Don't bother looking here, this is more like a meme repository I made in 2 hours in the high school's computer lab.

Some little functions for C++ that are made to use all the computer's resources. Just made this because I'm bored.

Use this at your own risk, I'm not responsible for any damage you do.

You would normally use the HardDriveDestroyer function because it does it's purpose very well :D
